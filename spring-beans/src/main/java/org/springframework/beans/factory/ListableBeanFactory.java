/**
 * {@link BeanFactory}接口的扩展，由Bean工厂实现
 * 可以枚举其所有的bean实例，而不是尝试通过名字一个一个的查询bean
 * BeanFactory实现了预加载器所有的BeanDefinition（比如基于XML的工厂）可以实现这个接口
 * <p>
 * 如果是一个{@link HierarchicalBeanFactory}层级BeanFactory，返回的值可能不会考虑BeanFactory的层次结构，使用{@link BeanFactoryUtils}帮助类来考虑在父类工厂里装配
 * 这个接口中的方法仅会尊重该工厂的bean定义，会忽略那些通过其他方式注入的单例bean
 * （比如{@link org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ConfigurableBeanFactory}的{@code registerSingleton}方法）
 * {@code getBeanNamesOfType}和{@code getBeansOfType}的异常会检查这样的手动注入的bean
 * 当然，BeanFactory的{@code getBean}方法允许透明访问此类特殊的bean
 * 然而，在通常场景下，所有bean无论如何都将由外部BeanDefinition来定义，所以大多数应用不需要关心区别
 * <p>
 * 需要注意的是，{@code getBeanDefinitionCount}和{@code containsBeanDefinition}的异常，此接口中的方法不会频繁调用
